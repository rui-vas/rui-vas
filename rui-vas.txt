### Founder & Chief Product - AI Text to Speech for Audiobooks
radiobooks ¬∑ Full-time
Aug 2021 - Aug 2023 ¬∑ 2 yrs 1 mo
- Envisioned Radiobooks as a mission to spread knowledge in audiobook format, leveraging cost efficiency that the latest AI text-to-speech would bring to audio production
- Took part in Microsoft for Startups and Nvidia ignite programs
- Failed to find product-market fit

B2C (first 6 mo):
coded MVP, launched a B2C audible-like app for Portugal with public domain books, applied gorilla marketing to acquire 2k users, failed to get copyrights from local publishers, low LTV.

B2B (second 18 mo): 
with a better understanding of the market, pivoted towards being an audio production service provider for publishing companies. Sold paid POCs to publishers and book distribution companies with a catalog of ~700k books (Bookwire, LeYa, Porto Editora, Clube de Autores), with 90% margin. Failed to convert POCs into recurring sales. Couldn't get audio quality to human-like. HITL approach proved to be costly and high in ops for marginal gains in quality. Built a small team with limited resources and worked on fundraising. 

Wrong key assumption: 
we build our audio production tech on top of Azure TTS, which was at the time better than Google and Amazon. I assumed that the best quality TTS would come from one of these big players, and their technology was producing audio out of SSML files. So we worked on optimising for SSML generation and adding value with HITL, while other startups like ElevenLabs (who just raised $80M) managed to outperform the big players in audio quality with proprietary tech - kudos to them!- Envisioned Radiobooks as a mission to spread knowledge in audiobook format, leveraging cost efficiency that the latest AI text-to-speech would bring to audio production - Took part in Microsoft for Startups and Nvidia ignite programs - Failed to find product-market fit B2C (first 6 mo): coded MVP, launched a B2C audible-like app for Portugal with public domain books, applied gorilla marketing to acquire 2k users, failed to get copyrights from local publishers, low LTV.

## Testemonials

### Pedro Le√£o da Cruz
Engineering Manager @ Canonical
"Rui is a competent and engaging leader with an incredible ability to tell a story. During our time working together, I've witnessed Rui build a clear vision for a Kubeflow offering from the ground up - including team hiring and product development. He is highly regarded by everyone - C levels and engineers - and comes across as a very empathetic person: the kind of colleague that makes you glad about your workplace."

### Jonathan Sage
Senior Manager, Data Management at Oportun
"I got to know Rui this past year when we were both enrolled in the Silicon Valley chapter of Founder Institute. I was immediately impressed with his drive and work ethic. He was accepted to the Lisbon chapter but due to factors outside of his control, his cohort's start date was pushed back several months. Rather than accept downtime, he took it upon himself to find a cohort to join with an earlier start date and within a few weeks, moved to the US and began working. 

Our program was extremely challenging, but Rui was one of the few people that was able to complete it. I can say for certain that his analytical, organizational and leadership skills all had a hand in leading him to graduation. Most impressive to me though was Rui's validation of every assumption and his willingness to start over despite time and effort invested in a given path. To be clear: this did not mean that Rui would fall behind. It meant that he did what it took to stay current or even ahead with the rest of the cohort. To me, that says that Rui will always handle every task that is presented to him with an amazing determination to get it done. In fact, early in our program I had actually hired Rui to help me with an aspect of my company because I knew that no matter what, he could execute. As a business owner who monitors expenses closely, I had zero issues in doing so as I knew it would be money well invested. 

Looking forward to working with Rui again!"
